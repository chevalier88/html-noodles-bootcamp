          Heat up a wok with the cooking oil until it begins to smoke. Add the
          scallion strips and stir continuously with the spatula until the
          scallions are aromatic and becomes&nbsp;<u>moderately burned</u>.
          (This process will release the full fragrance of the scallions and
          infuses the scallion oil with the intense aroma.) Set aside the
          scallion oil.
        </li>
        <li id="mv_create_600_2">
          Heat up a pot of water until it boils. Cook the fresh noodles&nbsp;<em
            >al dente</em
          >. The noodles should be cooked through but still somewhat firm and
          springy. Drain the noodles and transfer into a bowl.
        </li>
        <li id="mv_create_600_3">
          Add the scallion oil, oyster sauce and soy sauce into the noodles.
          Using a pair of chopsticks, toss the noodles to blend well with the
          scallion oil and seasoning sauces. Serve immediately.
