        </li>

          small pieces.
        </li>

          liquid reduces.
        </li>

        <li>
          Soak the dried chinese mushrooms in warm water till completely soft

        </li>
        <li>
          Squeeze out the water of each mushroom, and cut it into relatively
          thin slices.

          Add the oyster sauce and a few tablespoons of water (from the
          mushrooms) cook under medium-low heat and allow the mushrooms to
